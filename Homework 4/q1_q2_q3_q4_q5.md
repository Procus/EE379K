Question 1

True, replacing a safe Boolean SRSW register array with an array of regular M-valued SRSW registers does yield a regular M-valued MRSW register. Regular registers satisfy the following conditions:

1. It is never the case that `Ri → Wi`
2. It is never the case that for some `j` : `Wi → Wj → Ri`
3. If a read overlaps a write, it returns either the old or the new value (18)

If `read()` and write() calls to do not overlap, read() returns the most recent value. If they do overlap, one of the three happens:

1. If `r_table[ThreadID.get()]` has not been written yet, the old value is
returned.
2. If `r_table[ThreadID.get()]` has already been written, the new value is
returned.
3. If `r_table[ThreadID.get()]` is being written as it is being read, it can
return either the old value or the new value (as `r_table` is composed of
regular registers).

All conditions are satisifed, thus the construction does a yield a regular M-valued MRSW register.

Question 2
----
False, replacing a safe Boolean MRSW register with a safe M-valued MRSW register does not yield a regular M-valued MRSW register. If this were a regular M-valued MRSW register, it would need to return either the old or the new value in case of a `read()` overlapping a write(). In the original case, the `new != old` check is binary so it must equal the old or the new. This will not be the same case with M-valued registers, since an overlapping `write()` can return any element. Therefore the construction is not yield a regular M-valued MRSW register.

Question 5
----
In `FifoConsensus` with a focus on `peek()`, the `decide()` method will produce a wait-free solution because there are no loops as well as no `dequeue()` which means that it is not possible for the value of the multiple threads can read different values when calling the `peek()` function. As a result, the `peek()` method has an infinite consensus number. To put it simpler, infinite threads can agree upon the same return value for `peek()` since there is no `dequeue()`
