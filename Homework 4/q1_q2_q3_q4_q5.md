Question 1
----
True, replacing a safe Boolean SRSW register array with an array of regular M-valued SRSW registers does yield a regular M-valued MRSW register. Regular registers satisfy the following conditions: 
1. it is never the case that Ri → Wi
2. it is never the case that for some j : Wi → Wj → Ri
3. if a read overlaps a write, it returns either the old or the new value (18)

If read() and write() calls to do not overlap, read() returns the most recent value. If they do overlap, one of the three happens:

1. 1. If r_table[ThreadID.get()] has not been written yet, the old value is
returned.
2. If r_table[ThreadID.get()] has already been written, the new value is
returned.
3. If r_table[ThreadID.get()] is being written as it is being read, it can
return either the old value or the new value (as r_table is composed of
regular registers).

All conditions are satisifed, thus the construction does a yield a regular M-valued MRSW register.

Question 2

False, replacing a safe Boolean MRSW register with a safe M-valued MRSW register does not yield a regular M-valued MRSW register. If this were a regular M-valued MRSW register, it would need to return either the old or the new value in case of a read() overlapping a write(). In the original case, the new != old check is binary so it must equal the old or the new. This will not be the same case with M-valued registers, since an overlapping write() can return any element. Therefore the construction is not yield a regular M-valued MRSW register.
