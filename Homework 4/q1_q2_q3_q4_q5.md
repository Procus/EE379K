Question 1
----
False, replacing a safe Boolean SRSW register array with an array of regular M-valued SRSW registers does not yield a regular M-valued MRSW register. To create a M-valued MRSW register you need to represent the value in unary notation. In this construction, the write function sets a single bit to true and the rest to false. The read function iterates through the bits and returns the value. In the proposed construction, the write function is set up to write all values of `s_table` to the passed Boolean value. If you were to write an Integer into every index of the proposed `s_table` M-value register array the read function will return any arbitrary value or a null regardless of the M-value range.
