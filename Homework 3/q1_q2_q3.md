Question 1
----
To prove sequential consistency, we need to show that method calls appear to take effect in program order. In other words, we need to satify the logical sequence of program execution. 

For *Figure 3.13*, we **can** arrange the methods so values are written and read correctly as follows:

```
r.write(1) >> r.read(1) >> r.write(2) >> r.read(2)

```
While for *Figure 3.14* we **can** arrange them as follows:

```
r.write(1) >> r.read(1) >> r.read(1) >> r.write(2)

```

If you look at the figures, it is clearly possible to interleave the code to do the aforementioned cases thus both figures are sequentially consistent.

--------
To prove linearizability, we must look at the timelines more carefully and keep in mind that each operation appears to take effect atomically at some point between its invocation and completion. In other words, any read to a shared data item must return the value stored by the most recent write operation on that item.

For *Figure 3.13* and *Figure 3.14*, we **can** arrange them follows to show linearizability.
```
r.write(1) >> r.read(1) >> r.write(2) >> r.read(2)
```

Question 2
----
This implementation is not linearizable. To prove this, consider the following case:

| Time | Thread A | Thread B   |
| :-------: | :----: | :---: |
| **1** | `call enq(X)` |  |
| **2** | `slot=0`   |  `call deq(X)`   |
| **3** |     |  `throws Exception`  |
| **4** | `item[slot]=X`    |    |
| **5** | `return`    |    |

In the case of `IQueue`, the write is not an atomic operation. With the linearizability constraint, every read expects to get the value of last write. With the `Exception` being thrown at `Time 4`, the queue fails to uphold the linearizability constraint.

Question 3
----
Yes. It is possible for an `ArithmeticException`. 

Notice that `int x` is not set as `volatile` which means that threads will access their cached values instead of directly accessing the memory. In other words, if `read()` is called, there will be cases where the new value of `x` (which in this case is `42`) will only be be propagated into other threads long after `v` (a volatile variable) is set to `true`. As a result, threads that calls `write()` immediately can potentially read `x` as `0` and cause a `DivideByZero` error.
