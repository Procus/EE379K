Homework 3
=====

#Question 1
All method calls have an invocation and a response highlighted by a write and a read. Since there are points between the points of invocation and response times then that means both histories are linearizable. This inherently also means that they are both sequentially consistent and quiscently consistent.


#Question 2
This implementation is not linearizable. Let's say for example there are two threads. Thread 1 calls enq(1) and it executes until it is about to set item[0] to 1 but it does not finish because tail.compareAndSet(slot, slot+1) will always be false. Meanwhile, Thread 2 calls enq(2) and completes because head.compareAndSet(slot, slot+1) will return true. After that, Thread 2 will call deq() which will remove item[0] and throw an execption since value of item[0] has not been set. Therefore, this is not linearizable because Thread 2 enques, deques but then has an exception thrown when it should have gotten a value for item[0].
