Question 1

The Stack class has consensus number exactly two because:

- **Consensus Object**: The method T decide(T value) is called by each thread at most once. It is therefore *consistent* and *valid*.
- **Consensus Protocol**: A consensus solution that is both wait-free and lock-free.
- **Consensus Number**: A class C solves n-thread consensus if there exists a consensus protocol for any number of obejcts of class C and atomic registers. Therefore, a consensus number is the alrgest n for which class C solves n-thread consensus.

The protocol is wait-free since `decide()` contains no loops and `Stack` is inherently wait-free. There are two possible scenarios when a thread returns a value:
    1. Both threads return their own input meaning both must have popped `WIN`, violating the `Stack` protocol.
    2. Both threads return the other's input also violating the protocol.
In addition, the protocol states that at least one of the proposed values must be returned because its winning is value is written before `WIN` is popped.

```
class StackConsensus<T> {
    Stack s;
    T[] proposed;
    StackConsensus(){
        s.push(LOSE);
        s.push(WIN);
    }
    T decide(T value){
        proposed[threadID] = value;
        if (s.pop() == WIN){
            return proposed[threadID];
        } else {
            return proposed[1-threadID];
        }
    }
}
```
To prove that the `Stack` class has a consensus number of exactly two we must h
