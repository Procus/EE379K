The Stack class has consensus number exactly two because:
    - **Consensus Object**: The method T decide(T value) is called by each thread at most once. It is therefore *consistent* and *valid*.
    - **Consensus Protocol**: A consensus solution that is both wait-free and lock-free.
    - **Consensus Number**: A class C solves n-thread consensus if there exists a consensus protocol for any number of obejcts of class C and atomic registers. Therefore, a consensus number is the alrgest n for which class C solves n-thread consensus.
    The protocol is wait-free since `decide()` contains no loops and `Stack` is inherently wait-free. If each thread
