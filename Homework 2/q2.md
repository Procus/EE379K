Question 2
--------------

If a read occurs concurrently with a write, the Bakery algorithm should still work properly. The only time that there is a read and write is when threads are looking for the maximum label and assigning themselves with one plus that. During such a case it does not matter if the read is assigned the old value or new value since one will be added to it anyways. More so, if there are two labels of the same order, the Bakery algorithm compensates by letting the thread of higher lexographic order to continue. As a result, the Bakery algorithm will always work for any order order of label even if there are duplicates.
